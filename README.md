# wordleScorer
A simple chrome extension that scores you on wordle based on the average number of guesses you took, with a penalty of 10 for failed attempts. Built as a challenge in 2 hours, with no prior chrome-extension experience and very limited web-dev experience. .

See https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/#unpacked to set it up.
